ðŸ“± React Native Quiz App
This was my first project using React and React Native, created as a learning experience to explore the basics of building mobile apps with these technologies.

ðŸŽ® Game Modes
The app includes three simple quiz-style game modes:

Guess the Flag

Guess the Country

Guess the Monument

ðŸ’¾ Data Handling
All data (flags, countries, monuments) is stored locally in JSON files â€” there are no API calls or external dependencies for data fetching. This helped me focus on React Native fundamentals like navigation, state management, and component structuring without backend complexity.
